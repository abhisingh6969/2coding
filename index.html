As a new student, you’ll need to learn a lot of new information pretty fast or risk being clueless, penniless, and more than a bit confused about independent student life.
<br><br>
This is where the internet steps in, a realm of student resources with bountiful information about anything, where you can learn the things your parents never taught you (or that you weren’t interested in learning at the time), such as how to budget your money, how to arrange an overdraft with your bank, and how to iron your clothes without leaving an iron-shaped pattern. In short, all the student resources you could ever possibly need are available online.
<br><br>
Below is a categorized list of useful student websites and online resources that will help to make student life that little bit easier from day one.
<br><br>
General websites for students<br>
<h1>
1. LifeHacker.co.uk<br>
</h1>
ifeHacker aims to help its users out with life in the modern world. Popular tags include ‘Productivity’, ‘Money’ and ‘DIY’.
<h2>
2. MentalFloss.com
</h2>
Although essentially one of many time-wasting student websites, MentalFloss is good for learning interesting facts from around the world, covering topics such as food, culture and science. Admittedly, its main function may be as a procrastination aid, but you should still learn something.  
<h3>
3. UnplugTheTV.com
</h3>
This student resource offers an alternative to TV (and, unfortunately, studying), hosting randomized videos on interesting scientific topics.
<h4>
4. Sleepyti.me
</h4>
This site tells you the best times to go to bed if you have to be up at a certain hour – a very useful tool within student life. Taking into account regular sleep cycles, Sleepyti.me can help if you suffer from grogginess in the mornings.
<h5>
5. KeepMeOut.com
</H5>
If you struggle to stay away from social media when you’re meant to be studying, use KeepMeOut to block certain distracting websites.
